The lie is being committed in this Turning Point. Something someone said or claimed is false. For instance, a vampire lord claims he knows nothing of a magic book, when actually he is seeking it himself. The lie may or may not be detected in this Turning Point.</p> <p>FAME: Whatever is happening in this Turning Point involves someone famous to some extent. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that a famous Character is Invoked, just that the Turning Point has some connection to fame. For instance, if this Turning Point involves learning a secret about another Character, you may learn that they were once a member of a famous superhero group decades ago</p> <p>EVIDENCE: A Character finds something that helps settle an existing question. For instance, the gun that killed a victim is found stashed under a suspect\u2019s bed.</p> <p>A NEW ENEMY: This Turning Point presents a new threat to a Character. It is a threat that may or may not be directly related to any Plotlines but must be dealt with all the same. For instance, explorers deep under the earth are moving through an ancient ruin to find their lost comrade when they are beset upon by dinosaurs who nest in the area. This results automatically in a New Character.</p> <p>Okay, for my first Scene, this is what I have so far.... </p> <p>Rudy doesn't have the envelope with the tape, yet. It's just a regular day at Shepherd's Inn, mid afternoon, when someone who looks like a dirty hitch-hiker comes through the door.</p> <p>This is Bram, who has been hitch-hiking, and is looking for some place he can busk for a meal and maybe a place to sleep. He's pushy -- his role, at least right now, is to be an obstacle to the plotline (which doesn't exist yet, technically) -- and Rudy gets sick of him pretty quickly.</p> <p>This results in Rudy attempting to bodily throw Bram out of the Inn when something happens to reveal that Bram is not only NOT a dirty hitch-hiking busker but he's someone famous; like a famous musician who puts on a disguise to avoid notice as well as busks to try out new songs. </p> <p>For Rudy to know this guy is famous, he would probably have to be some sort of country / western musician. Maybe he's even seen him in concert once or twice. </p> <p>That revelation will calm Rudy down a bit and he and Bram start talking -- Rudy's still annoyed, but once Bram's cover is blown (to only Rudy, as the bar is otherwise empty) Bram stops trying to get a gig and will actually pay for some food. </p> <p>Then the mail comes. This is where the tape arrives, and Rudy doesn't have any reason to believe it's anything that needs to be secret -- other than the anonymous envelope -- so he pops it in to the Inn's stereo and both he and Bram hear the transcript (above).</p> <p>Also, while the tape is playing, Dr. Kahn shows up. Rudy is understandably shocked to see her looking as young as when he last saw her. Because of their previous professional relationship, Amina tells Rudy that she's been hired to come find him -- which is weird because she's not some sort of private investigator, but she did know who he was so... -- and she's not sure what her employers want with him, but she'll be telling them later this evening (probably via phone) that she's found him. He'll try to talk her out of it, even going as far as offering money, but she's true to her word.</p>"},{"location":"Sessions/2024-10-30/2024-10-30%20Adventure%20Sheet/#turning-point-2-random-encounter-between-shepherds-and-megs","title":"Turning Point: 2 (Random Encounter between Shepherd's and Meg's)","text":""},{"location":"Sessions/2024-10-30/2024-10-30%20Adventure%20Sheet/#plotline","title":"Plotline:","text":"<ul> <li>[v] New Plotline</li> <li> Development</li> <li> Conclusion</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Sessions/2024-10-30/2024-10-30%20Adventure%20Sheet/#plot-points","title":"Plot Points","text":"Plot Points Characters Invoked 1 Quiet Catastrophe 2 A Resource Disappears 3 Meta (Character Upgrade) 4 Something Exotic 5 None ## Notes QUIET CATASTROPHE: Just about the worst thing that can happen does happen. This is similar to the Action Plot Point Catastrophe, except that it is accompanied by less action. For instance, a colonizing spaceship stops midway through a 40 year journey, waking everyone up from their cryo sleep. Or, the investigator discovers the ancient vampire he had destroyed is, somehow, back. <p>A RESOURCE DISAPPEARS: An important object or resource is stolen by an unknown thief. The resource should be something either useful to a Character, or it should pertain to the Plotline in question.</p> <p>SOMETHING EXOTIC: Whatever is happening in this Turning Point it involves an unusual or exotic element. For instance, if the Turning Point is about someone being attacked by an assassin, the assassin may have a very unusual identity or mode of attack (maybe he\u2019s disguised as a clown and attacks with exploding balloons, or he is a martial artist with fantastic moves).</p> <p>Meta: CHARACTER UPGRADE: A Character becomes more important, gaining 2 slots on the Characters List even if it pushes them past 3 slots. When you roll on the Characters List to see who the Character is, treat a result of \u201cNew Character\u201d as \u201cChoose The Most Logical Character\u201d.

Thought I was done with whatever ghosts this county had to offer, but it seems like they\u2019ve come back around.</p> <p>Started off routine. No sign I was about to be dragged back into this mess. Then this morning, a padded envelope lands on my bar, completely anonymous\u2014no stamp, no return address, nothing. Inside, an old cassette tape. Popped it into the boombox. Should\u2019ve been something simple, a prank or advertisement maybe, but what I heard was Clara. Her voice, nervous, talking to someone named Danny. She kept saying she felt unsafe, that she\u2019d seen shadows, heard whispers. I know what paranoia sounds like, but this felt different, darker.</p> <p>The tape cut out, left me with nothing but questions. First one on my list? Danny. Trish said he\u2019s out of town now, but pointed me toward Mike Hastings, an old friend of his. Before I could make it to the diner to talk to her, though, I could\u2019ve sworn I saw Clara herself\u2014clear as day\u2014in the bed of my truck. Lost control for a second, hit a deer. By the time I checked, she was gone, and the cassette had disappeared from my truck.</p> <p>Met up with Trish, who confirmed that Danny\u2019s been hard to reach, drifting around since Clara went missing. She mentioned Mike over at the body shop by the train station might still be in touch with him. Sure enough, Mike had a number for Danny. Didn\u2019t give it up easily, but he\u2019s clearly just as haunted by all this as the rest of us. Warned me not to say his name, said Danny\u2019s not the same as he was.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know what\u2019s waiting for me at the end of this, but I feel it. King County\u2019s never been an easy place to call home, and days like today make me wonder if it\u2019s worth sticking around. But maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014some closure on Clara\u2019s disappearance will help us all sleep a little better.</p> <p>Notes:</p> <ul> <li>Clara: Last known location unclear. Possible links to local disappearances.</li> <li>Danny: Known associate, currently out of town. Reaching out tomorrow.</li> <li>Mike Hastings: Danny\u2019s contact. Cooperative but wary.</li> </ul> <p>P.S.</p> <p>On top of it all, ran into a hitchhiker at the Inn today. Name\u2019s Bram. Looked like he\u2019d been on the road a while, a real drifter type, but he gave off a weird vibe\u2014said he knew me, even used my name before I told him. Claimed it was just a lucky guess, but something tells me there\u2019s more to him.</p> <p>And then, like a ghost from my past, Amina showed up. Dr. Kahn, looking exactly like she did back in the Gulf\u2014same face, same voice, like time forgot her. Says she was sent to find me, though she wouldn\u2019t say why or by who. Left me her card, but I\u2019ve got the sinking feeling this isn\u2019t a friendly reunion. Whatever she\u2019s wrapped up in, it\u2019s not a coincidence she\u2019s here. It\u2019s all tied together somehow, but damned if I can see how yet.</p>"},{"location":"Sessions/2024-10-30/2024-11-02%20Casebook%20Log/#json","title":"JSON","text":"<p><pre><code>{\n  \"Date\": \"Today\",\n  \"Case File\": \"Clara\u2019s Disappearance (Reopened)\",\n  \"Summary\": {\n    \"Envelope\": {\n      \"Description\": \"Anonymous padded envelope with no stamp or return address.\",\n      \"Contents\": \"An unmarked audio cassette.\",\n      \"Significance\": \"Led to reopening Clara's disappearance case.\"\n    },\n    \"Cassette Recording\": {\n      \"Voices\": [\n        {\n          \"Name\": \"Clara\",\n          \"Description\": \"Nervous, young adult female, talking about seeing shadows and hearing whispers.\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Name\": \"Danny\",\n          \"Description\": \"Young adult male, calming Clara but urging caution.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"Cut-off\": \"Recording ends abruptly after Clara expresses fear of being watched.\",\n      \"Current Status\": \"Cassette went missing from Rudy's truck.\"\n    },\n    \"Road Incident\": {\n      \"Vision\": \"Rudy saw Clara in the bed of his truck while driving.\",\n      \"Accident\": \"Truck hit a deer, damaging the front end.\",\n      \"Deputy Encounter\": {\n        \"Officer\": \"Unnamed young deputy, recognized Rudy by name.\",\n        \"Warning\": \"Deputy mentioned recent strange noises and disappearances in the woods.\"\n      },\n      \"Result\": \"Cassette disappeared from truck after the accident.\"\n    },\n    \"Trish (Meg's Diner)\": {\n      \"Description\": \"Middle-aged waitress, Rudy\u2019s acquaintance.\",\n      \"Information Provided\": \"Suggested talking to Mike Hastings to reach Danny.\"\n    },\n    \"Mike Hastings\": {\n      \"Description\": \"Old friend of Danny\u2019s, works at auto body shop by the train station.\",\n      \"Information Provided\": \"Gave Rudy Danny\u2019s contact number, warned that Danny isn\u2019t the same.\",\n      \"Request\": \"Asked Rudy not to mention his name to Danny.\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"PS\": {\n    \"Bram\": {\n      \"Description\": \"Hitchhiker who approached Rudy at the Inn.\",\n      \"Significance\": \"Claimed to know Rudy\u2019s name before being told; feels suspicious.\"\n    },\n    \"Amina Kahn\": {\n      \"Description\": \"Appeared looking exactly as she did during the Gulf War, despite the years.\",\n      \"Purpose\": \"Sent to find Rudy, reason and employer unknown.\",\n      \"Card\": \"Left a contact card with Rudy.\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"Next Steps\": {\n    \"Contact Danny\": \"Use contact provided by Mike Hastings to follow up on Clara\u2019s case.\",\n    \"Follow-up on Amina\": \"Consider reaching out based on her business card if information or connections become relevant.\",\n    \"Track Cassette\": \"Figure out if or how the cassette disappeared and if anyone nearby might have taken it.\"\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> `</p>"},{"location":"Themes%20and%20Notes/Setting%20Notes/Setting%20Overview/","title":"Setting Overview","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Atmosphere: King County is shrouded in a persistent layer of gloom, both literally and figuratively.
