#### **Summary**

- **Background**: A vampire (not Dracula) arrived in a small [[California]] town with plans to open a portal to an unknown realm—possibly Limbo, the Abyss, or the Underworld. This portal was intended to bring darkness and corruptive energy, echoing the influence of [[The Wyrm]].
    
- **Gathering Forces**: The vampire’s presence attracted nearby supernatural forces, including [[California Werewolf Pack|the California Werewolf Pack]], who sensed the [[Wyrm Taint|Wyrm-taint]] and attempted to stop the vampire. The vampire’s followers included a flesh golem (following the rules of a Promethean), a twisted creation bound to serve him.
    
- **Monster Squad Intervention**: The only ones who uncovered the full scope of the vampire’s plan were Rudy and his friends, later dubbed [[The Monster Squad (group)|the Monster Squad]] With the help of [[Scary German Guy]], an experienced mage, they pieced together the vampire’s ritual and prepared to intervene.
    
- **The Ritual and Phoebe’s Awakening**: [[Scary German Guy]] harnessed [[Phoebe]]'s early [[Awakening]] potential to close the portal, using her energy as a “battery.” Though successful, this act traumatized Phoebe, leading to her current catatonic state. The ritual ended the vampire’s immediate threat but may have left residual energy in the area, creating a lasting scar on the supernatural fabric of the town.

#### **Lingering Effects and Consequences**

- **Residual Wyrm-Taint**: The ritual, combined with the vampire’s [[Wyrm Taint|Wyrm-tainted]] energy, left a permanent “mark” on the town. This lingering effect may have attracted other supernatural beings over the years or created subtle disturbances in the area.
    
- **Deaths and Disappearances of Monster Squad Members**: Following the incident, members of [[The Monster Squad (group)|the Monster Squad]] began dying under mysterious circumstances. [[Rudy Williams|Rudy]] suspects these deaths were connected to the vampire’s ritual, either as revenge or due to a supernatural “curse” left behind.
    
- **Phoebe’s Current Condition**: [[Phoebe]]’s trauma and early [[Awakening]] left her catatonic, trapped in a mental state that may still be linked to the portal’s energy. Her condition motivated [[Rudy Williams|Rudy]]’s move to [[King County, Colorado|King County]], where she resides in [[The Asylum]].
    
- **Unresolved Role of the Promethean**: The vampire’s Promethean follower was destroyed, but traces of its energy or parts may remain. This creature’s twisted essence might still affect the location or even extend to [[King County, Colorado|King County]].
