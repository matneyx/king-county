aliases:
  - the Werewolf Pack
---
**Pack Name:** Unknown (specific name not given in past notes)

**Role in Setting:** Failed to stop the vampire in [[California]], resulting in one member being blood-bound; potential supernatural allies or wary observers of [[King County, Colorado|King County]]

**Current Status:** Presumed active, though their territory and members are unknown; may avoid [[King County, Colorado|King County]] due to its supernatural properties

---

#### **Background**

- **Role in [[The California Incident]]**: A local werewolf pack caught wind of the vampire’s ritual to open a portal, likely due to the [[Wyrm Taint|Wyrm-tainted]] energy emanating from his activities. They attempted to take down the vampire but were ultimately unsuccessful, resulting in one member being blood-bound to the vampire and forced to serve him.
    
- **Failed Confrontation**: This confrontation left the pack weakened and wary of high-risk supernatural threats. Their failure to prevent the portal ritual may have solidified their reluctance to intervene directly with powerful supernatural beings unless absolutely necessary.
    
- **Pack Structure**: It’s unclear if the pack has traditional roles (such as alpha, beta, etc.) or operates with a more decentralized structure. They may be tied to a larger network of werewolf packs, which could impact their response to [[King County, Colorado|King County]]’s unusual reputation.

#### **Abilities and Traits**

- **Heightened Awareness of [[Wyrm Taint]]**: The pack possesses a strong sensitivity to [[The Wyrm|Wyrm]]-corrupted energy, which may make them aware of the residual effects of the vampire’s portal. This awareness could explain why they’ve avoided [[King County, Colorado|King County]], as it may hold echoes of corruption that put them on edge.
    
- **Supernatural Combat Skills**: As werewolves, the pack has experience with supernatural combat and the power dynamics of supernatural creatures. This would have made them formidable allies in [[California]], had they succeeded, and could make them potential allies or adversaries for [[Rudy Williams|Rudy]] in the future.
    
- **Potential Knowledge of [[King County, Colorado|King County]]**: Their knowledge of [[The Wyrm|Wyrm]] corruption might give them insight into the no-man’s-land effect surrounding King County, even if they avoid it. They may have records or oral histories explaining why the area is unsafe for supernatural beings.

#### **Influence and Legacy**

- **Reputation for Survival**: Though they failed in [[California]], the werewolf pack likely carries a reputation among local supernatural circles for their resilience and knowledge of corrupted entities. This reputation might precede them if they enter [[King County, Colorado|King County]], potentially creating tension with local entities.
    
- **Unresolved Grudge Against Vampires**: The pack’s history with the vampire in [[California]] may leave them with a lingering distrust or even a vendetta against vampires, especially if they feel the blood-bound member was never freed from their influence. This could lead them to distrust [[Rudy Williams|Rudy]] initially or seek to test his allegiances if they cross paths.
