> *This is for the Monster Squad faction.  For the film, see [[The Monster Squad (Movie)]]*

**Founded By:** [[Rudy Williams|Rudy]] and a group of friends (including [[Phoebe]], Sean, Patrick, and others)

**Current Status:** Disbanded; most members are presumed deceased or missing

**Primary Purpose:** Originally formed to investigate strange occurrences in their [[California]] hometown, culminating in a battle to prevent a vampire from opening a portal to a supernatural realm.
#### **Background**

- **Origin and Purpose**: The Monster Squad began as a group of neighborhood kids interested in monsters and horror movies. They accidentally stumbled upon a real supernatural threat when a vampire attempted to open a portal in their town, using [[Wyrm Taint|Wyrm-tainted]] magic and dark rituals.
    
- **The Portal Incident**: Their investigation led them to confront a vampire (different from the Dracula depicted in the film) who sought to open a portal to a realm like Limbo, the Abyss, or the Underworld. Assisted by a nearby werewolf pack, the kids worked with an older mage ([[Scary German Guy]]) who used [[Phoebe]]’s latent magical power to close the portal.
    
- **Aftermath**: While they succeeded, the experience had lasting effects. [[Phoebe]] was left traumatized and eventually became catatonic, while the other kids scattered. Some ended up in dangerous situations, ultimately leading to their disappearances or deaths. [[Rudy Williams|Rudy]] believes these deaths are connected to the original incident and suspects they’re being hunted.

#### **Notable Members**

- **[[Rudy Williams]]**: Served as the group’s leader during the portal incident. Now a hardened veteran and protector of [[Phoebe]], Rudy suspects the group’s former members were systematically eliminated. His determination to uncover the truth keeps him on high alert.
    
- **[[Phoebe]]**: The youngest and most sensitive to supernatural forces, Phoebe served as a magical conduit to close the portal. Her current state leaves her unable to assist, but she remains a significant figure, especially for Rudy.
    
- **[[Scary German Guy]] (Mage)**: Assisted in closing the portal, using his knowledge of the arcane and ritual magic. His current whereabouts are unknown, though Rudy remembers him as an important ally.

#### **Influence and Legacy**

- **Unresolved Threats**: [[Rudy Williams|Rudy]] suspects that the Monster Squad’s activities have put a target on the backs of the original members. He believes that whatever supernatural force tried to breach into their world may be slowly eliminating all witnesses.
    
- **Potential for Resurrection**: The legacy of the Monster Squad could make it a symbol for younger, local groups interested in paranormal events or investigating unusual occurrences in [[King County, Colorado]], especially if the local supernatural undercurrents become more active.
    
- **Impact on Rudy**: The traumatic events solidified Rudy’s dedication to defending the innocent and protecting [[Phoebe]]. His loyalty to the Monster Squad’s memory keeps him grounded but also haunted.
