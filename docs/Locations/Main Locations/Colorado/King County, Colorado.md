#### **Supernatural Significance**

- **No-Man’s-Land Status**: King County’s supernatural reputation is one of avoidance and mystery. Even powerful supernatural creatures, including werewolves and vampires, keep their distance, leaving the area with an unspoken aura of corruption or danger.
    
- **Residual [[Wyrm Taint]]**: There are whispers among supernatural circles that King County holds traces of Wyrm-tainted energy, a contamination often tied to corruption and decay. Some believe that this energy dates back to a failed ritual or an ancient curse, giving rise to the region’s “cursed” status.
    
- **Interdimensional Qualities**: The strange energy in King County may act as a thin veil between realms, contributing to its avoided status. Supernatural beings who venture too close describe sensations of vertigo, as though they’re teetering on the edge of a chasm or another dimension.
