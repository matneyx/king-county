> *Based on the Roadhouse from Supernatural, and The Garage on Beck Street*

Located in [[Shepherd Junction, Colorado]]
Owned by [[Rudy Williams]]

Shepherd's Inn is a rundown roadhouse, serving as both Rudy's home base and unofficial hub for anyone seeking supernatural help.

There is an old Winnebago and old cab-over camper parked out back.

Despite the name, the Inn has no rooms for rent.

Due to the appearance of its clientele and its beat up nature, the road house doesn't get much business from people that don't already know what it is.
