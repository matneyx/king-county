**Located:** [[Stanton City, Colorado]]

Our Lady of Hope Chapel was once the primary religious location of [[Stanton City, Colorado|Stanton City]], where it housed a Catholic priest, but also allowed for many other denominations of Christian faiths to practice and to hold services. Over the years, the other faiths built or bought their own churches, or simply fell away, while the Catholic population grew.

In 1985, the [[Cathedral of Saint Paul]] was built to provide a location for the Catholic masses to be held, and Our Lady of Hope’s congregation slowly dwindled, until it officially closed it’s doors in 1986.

The Catholic Church still owns the building and land, though it has gone unused for a quarter-century. It’s windows have been boarded up, and the doors chained, to prevent squatters, but anyone that has been in Stanton City for more than a few months can tell you that not even vagabonds will enter that building.
