- **Interest in Phoebe**: As the person who helped harness [[Phoebe]]’s magical potential, he may have a personal interest in her [[Awakening]] or a sense of responsibility for her current state.

### [[King County, Colorado]]
- **Source of the [[Wyrm Taint]]**: Could the area’s no-man’s-land status be tied to a specific supernatural event, ritual, or curse that happened long ago? Is it possible that the energy from the vampire’s portal incident somehow resonates with King County’s taint?
- **Connection to Other Realms**: The interdimensional qualities of King County may mean that it serves as a bridge to other realms, potentially the same one the vampire tried to access in [[California]]. Is there a portal or a weakened veil in the area that could explain its reputation?

- **Lingering Influence Over the [[Blood Bond|Blood-Bound]] Werewolf**: If the werewolf bound to him wasn’t truly freed, there may be residual effects of the Vampire’s influence. It’s possible the werewolf remains affected, potentially posing a future threat to [[King County, Colorado|King County]] or even to [[Rudy Williams|Rudy]].
- **Portal Connections Beyond California**: Did the Vampire’s portal magic have ramifications beyond the [[California]] town, possibly influencing places like [[King County, Colorado|King County]]? The [[Wyrm Taint|Wyrm-tainted]] energy could have left a mark that resonates across regions, drawing Rudy to yet another haunted location.
- **Final Fate of the Vampire**: Is the Vampire truly gone, or could he have survived in some form? If he managed to partially enter the realm he was trying to open, he might still retain influence in the mortal world, waiting for an opportunity to return.
### [[The Promethean]]
- **Fate Beyond the Portal**: If the Promethean survived his journey through the portal, could he be attempting to continue his Pilgrimage on the other side?

- **Connection to Phoebe’s Condition**: Given his bond with [[Phoebe]], could her catatonic state be influenced by his disappearance? There may be a psychic or magical link between them that lingers, suggesting that his return could help her recovery.
- **Residual Wasteland Effect in King County**: If the [[Wyrm Taint|Wyrm-taint]] in King County has origins connected to [[The Vampire]] and Promethean, the Promethean’s Disquiet may resonate here. His journey toward humanity could be leaving subtle effects on the land, either amplifying or counteracting the area’s supernatural isolation. 
- **Ongoing Pilgrimage and Redemption**: If the Promethean returns, could he be further along in his Pilgrimage, perhaps possessing greater knowledge or even new supernatural abilities? His desire for humanity may make him an ally to [[Rudy Williams|Rudy]], provided they can find common ground in their shared trauma.
