aliases:
  - Missy
---
- **Type**: Vampire Spirit (formerly of the [[Malkavian Clan]])
- **Background**:
    - Missy, a former brothel owner in Castle Dell, GA, embraced both [[Harv]] and [[Mickey Two-Dice|Mickey]]. After her diablerie, her spirit became tied to Mickey, now residing in his mind alongside Harv.

**Appearance**: Missy has a striking, slightly wild look, reminiscent of someone who’s both dangerous and alluring. She’s styled in a way that exudes glamour with a rough edge, often dressed in bold, old-fashioned attire that hints at her former life as a brothel owner in Castle Dell, Georgia. Her expression is sharp, with eyes that hold a hint of cunning and mischief, always assessing and ready to take advantage of any situation. Though spectral now, Missy maintains a vivid, almost tactile presence.

**Personality**: Missy is cunning and manipulative, with a dark sense of humor and an edge that reflects her Malkavian lineage. As the one who Embraced both Harv and Mickey, she holds a maternal yet controlling influence over them, though she hides key truths about her own death and Harv’s disembodied state. Missy fully remembers her own diablerization by [[Missy Chamberlain|Missy]] and uses this knowledge to her advantage, guiding him with cryptic advice while keeping her motives hidden. Her spirit is tied to Mickey’s mind, where she’s an ever-present influence, oscillating between helpful and self-serving. Her occasional, almost affectionate behavior belies her true intentions, as she revels in the irony of her undead “family.”

**Relationship with Mickey**: Knowing more than she lets on, Missy manipulates Mickey with a mix of affection and hidden agendas. She enjoys watching him struggle with his memory lapses, occasionally giving him cryptic advice to steer him without revealing the truth of their past.

**Current Influence**:

- Missy has the ability to provide counsel to Mickey, using her past experiences to subtly guide him, though she also has her own agenda in mind.
