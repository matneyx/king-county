- **Type**: Vampire Spirit (formerly of the [[Malkavian Clan]])
- **Background**:
    - Harv was [[Missy Chamberlain|Missy]]’s first progeny, embraced before [[Mickey Two-Dice|Mickey]]. After being diablerized by Mickey, he became a disembodied spirit, joining Missy in haunting Mickey.

**Appearance**: Harv is a short, stout Caucasian man standing around 5'3" and weighing about 200 lbs, with a completely bald head and prominent jowls that give him a soft, round-faced look. His build and demeanor suggest a man who leads a largely sedentary life, with no hint of physical fitness or activity. Harv appears in his late 50s, with deep-set eyes behind thin wire-frame glasses that add a touch of intellect to his otherwise no-nonsense, weary expression. His attire—a worn jacket, high-collared shirt, and vest—reflects his working-class roots from the late 1800s, with a rugged, timeworn style fitting his tough, unrefined character.

**Personality**: Harv exudes a practical, no-frills demeanor, often giving blunt, tough-love advice. Despite being a spectral presence following his diablerization by [[Mickey Two-Dice]], he remains unaware of his disembodied state, considering himself very much an active part of Mickey’s life. Harv’s hardened, straightforward approach makes him a grounding influence in Mickey’s chaotic world, though he can be exasperated by Mickey’s memory lapses and unpredictable behavior. While he’s often critical, Harv is loyal to Mickey and views himself as a rough-around-the-edges mentor who doesn’t sugarcoat the truth.

 **Relationship with Mickey**: Harv considers himself Mickey’s mentor and often treats him with an almost begrudging care, though he doesn’t hold back his criticism when he thinks Mickey’s being foolish. Despite his stern demeanor, Harv is loyal to Mickey, even if he’s unaware of his own spectral state.

**Current Influence**:

- Harv offers Mickey advice based on his past experiences, sometimes functioning as a voice of reason, albeit one that may not always align with Mickey’s understanding of reality.
