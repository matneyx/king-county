**Type**: Werewolf (Tribeless)

**Background**: Doc was part of [[Rudy Williams|Rudy]]’s elite military team and underwent his First Change in the field, slaughtering the rest of the unit. Rudy went AWOL to hunt him for six months before the military discharged him. Doc has recently come to [[King County, Colorado|King County]], seeking Rudy’s help with an undisclosed matter.

**Current Activity**: Doc haunts the rural areas between [[Jackson Ridge, Colorado|Jackson Ridge]], [[Jensen, Colorado|Jensen]], [[Red Bridge, Colorado|Red Bridge]], and [[Brindle, Colorado|Brindle]], steering clear of populated areas and avoiding trouble. His presence has not attracted hunters, and he has maintained a low profile, likely wary of drawing Rudy’s attention.
