**Description**:  
Bramble, often called "Bram," is a wandering entertainer with a rugged charm. Standing at about 5'8", he has a wiry build that speaks of a life spent on the move. His scruffy, unkempt hair is a chaotic tangle of dark brown curls, often adorned with bits of twigs and leaves from his travels. His face is weathered and lined, with sunken cheeks and a perpetual five-o'clock shadow that hints at his rough lifestyle.

Bram’s clothing consists of mismatched layers—tattered, colorful fabrics that once belonged to a brighter life, now faded and dirt-stained from countless performances in the dirt and grime of back alleys and roadside gatherings. He carries a battered guitar slung over his shoulder, along with an assortment of odd trinkets and makeshift instruments. Despite his disheveled appearance, his bright blue eyes twinkle with mischief and a sense of adventure, and he possesses a natural talent for storytelling and song, captivating anyone who stops to listen.
