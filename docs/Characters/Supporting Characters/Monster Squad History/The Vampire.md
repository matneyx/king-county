**Real Name:** Unknown (referred to as “the Vampire”)

**Role in Setting:** Antagonist in [[The California Incident|The Portal Incident]], dark influence with lingering effects on the supernatural landscape

**Status:** Presumed destroyed (though some uncertainty may remain)

**Location of Origin:** [[California]] town (site of the Portal Incident)

#### **Background**

- **Goals and Motivation**: The Vampire came to a small [[California]] town with the intention of opening a portal to a supernatural realm, likely one of corruption such as Limbo, the Abyss, or the Underworld. His exact reasons remain mysterious—whether it was to gain power, serve a higher [[Wyrm Taint|Wyrm-tainted]] entity, or fulfill an ancient ritual is still unclear.
    
- **Connection to the Wyrm**: The Vampire’s power seemed infused with the corruptive essence of [[The Wyrm]]. This taint not only allowed him to manipulate supernatural energies but also attracted attention from a [[California Werewolf Pack|nearby werewolf pack]], who attempted to stop him.
    
- **Influence over Others**: The Vampire held sway over lesser supernatural beings, most notably a Promethean flesh golem he created and blood-bound werewolf minions forced into servitude. His presence exerted a powerful aura, commanding fear and obedience from weaker entities.

#### **Abilities and Traits**

- **Master of Ritual Magic**: The Vampire was highly skilled in ritual magic, especially in opening inter-dimensional portals and manipulating dark energy. His knowledge of forbidden spells and [[The Wyrm|Wyrm]]-infused rituals made him exceptionally dangerous.
    
- **Blood-Binding and Manipulation**: He possessed the ability to [[Blood Bond|blood-bind]] individuals, forcing them into loyalty or obedience. This trait extended to [[California Werewolf Pack|one of the werewolves]] , who served him unwillingly until the end. His mastery over manipulation made him not only powerful but also insidiously persuasive.
    
- **Durability and Cunning**: The Vampire was not easily defeated. Even the combined efforts of [[California Werewolf Pack|the Werewolf Pack]], [[The Monster Squad (group)|the Monster Squad]], and [[Scary German Guy] ]only managed to halt his ritual—not destroy him outright. This suggests he was both physically resilient and strategically evasive.

#### **Influence and Legacy**

- **Lingering Taint in California**: The Vampire’s ritual, though interrupted, left a lasting [[Wyrm Taint|Wyrm-taint]] on the town. This corruption may have residual effects, possibly drawing other supernatural entities to the area or impacting local human residents in subtle ways.
    
- **Mysterious Deaths of Monster Squad Members**: [[Rudy Williams|Rudy]] suspects that the Vampire, or some influence he left behind, could be responsible for the deaths of [[The Monster Squad (group)|the other Monster Squad members]]. Whether this is due to a lingering curse or the work of other followers is unclear.
    
- **Residual Connection to King County**: The no-man’s-land aura surrounding [[King County, Colorado|King County]] might echo the Vampire’s original intentions. His work with portal magic and [[Wyrm Taint]] could theoretically extend to this region, influencing supernatural boundaries.
