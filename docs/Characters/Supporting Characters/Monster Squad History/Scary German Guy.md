#### **Background**

- **Introduction to the Monster Squad**: The “Scary German Guy” was an older [[Mage]] who lived in the [[California]] town where the portal incident occurred. Known to the kids by his mysterious nickname, he was initially a reclusive figure, but his knowledge of the supernatural made him essential in stopping the vampire’s portal ritual.
    
- **Role in Closing the Portal**: Scary German Guy recognized [[Phoebe]]’s potential for [[Awakening]], despite her young age, and used her raw magical energy to power the ritual that closed the portal. This process left her traumatized, but it was the only way to prevent the vampire’s incursion.
    
- **Aftermath and Departure**: Once the portal was sealed, Scary German Guy retreated from public view, leaving [[Rudy Williams]] and the others to deal with the aftermath alone. His disappearance is another mystery, as no one knows where he went or if he’s even alive.
