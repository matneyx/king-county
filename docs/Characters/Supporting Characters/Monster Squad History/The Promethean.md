#### **Background**

- **Creation and Nature**: The Promethean was a flesh golem animated by the Divine Fire, giving him a semblance of life but lacking a human soul. As a creation of [[The Vampire]], he was initially bound to destroy [[The Monster Squad (group)|the Monster Squad]], driven by the Disquiet his unnatural presence caused in others.
    
- **Divine Fire and Disquiet**: While the Divine Fire allowed him to mimic humanity from a distance, his proximity to humans (or any mortal creatures) led to [[Disquiet]]. His presence caused a subtle but growing sense of unease in those around him, which could escalate to fear or even rage if he stayed in one place too long. This effect extended to the environment, leaving behind areas of supernatural taint or “Wastelands” if he lingered.
    
- **Desire for Humanity**: Upon encountering [[The Monster Squad (group)|the Monster Squad]], the Promethean was struck by their [[Humanity]]—their compassion, loyalty, and innocence in stark contrast to [[The Vampire]]’s cruelty. This encounter sparked a realization: through these children, he might understand his own path toward mortality. This connection deepened when he met [[Phoebe]], whose youth and latent magical energy seemed to resonate with him, drawing him closer to the concept of humanity and hope.
    
- **Sacrifice to Protect the Monster Squad**: Seeing an opportunity for redemption, the Promethean ultimately betrayed [[The Vampire]], aligning himself with [[Phoebe]] and [[The Monster Squad (group)|the children]]. In the final confrontation, he sacrificed himself to save them, allowing himself to be drawn into the portal in order to prevent the Vampire from succeeding. His last act was one of bravery and compassion, hinting that he may still be pursuing his [[Pilgrimage]].

#### **Abilities and Traits**

- **Resilience and Physical Power**: As a Promethean, he possessed immense strength and durability, making him a formidable enforcer and guardian. This strength allowed him to serve as [[The Vampire]]’s weapon against [[The Monster Squad (group)|the children]] initially.
    
- **Divine Fire and Disquiet**: The Promethean’s presence generated an aura of [[Disquiet]] that made humans uneasy, often escalating to hostility. This Disquiet extended to the land, causing decay or corruption to manifest around him, a phenomenon that could linger even after his departure.
    
- **Potential for Humanity**: The Promethean’s encounter with [[The Monster Squad (group)|the children]], particularly [[Phoebe]], kindled his desire for humanity. He saw in their compassion a path toward the [[Pilgrimage]]—a journey of self-discovery that could one day make him mortal, provided he completed its steps.

#### **Influence and Legacy**

- **Connection to Phoebe and the Monster Squad**: The Promethean’s alliance with [[Phoebe]] and [[The Monster Squad (group)|the Monster Squad]] left a lasting impact, especially on [[Rudy Williams|Rudy]], who remembers him as a tragic figure caught between monstrosity and humanity. This memory of their shared humanity inspires Rudy’s current drive to protect Phoebe.
    
- **Potential Survival in Another Realm**: Though he sacrificed himself by entering the portal, it’s plausible that the Promethean is still alive within whatever realm [[The Vampire]] attempted to access. If so, he may still be seeking the [[Pilgrimage]]’s steps, striving for humanity even in this other dimension.
    
- **Lingering Disquiet and Taint**: The Promethean’s presence in [[California]] left behind traces of supernatural corruption, subtly marking the land as a place of unease. It’s possible that the [[Disquiet]] he generated lingers near the portal’s location, leaving a Wasteland-like effect that attracts other supernatural entities or amplifies existing [[Wyrm Taint|Wyrm-taint]].
