**Alias/Nickname**: None

**Role in Setting**: Catalyst of the original supernatural events, Rudy’s primary motivation for staying in King County

**Based in**: Asylum in [[King County, Colorado]]
#### **Background**

- **Early Life and Connection to the Monster Squad**: Phoebe was a young child during the events in [[California]] that inspired [[The Monster Squad (Movie)]]. She was the youngest member of the group and had a naturally high affinity for the supernatural, showing early signs of [[Awakening]] that made her critical in closing the portal.

- **Role in the Portal Ritual**: [[Scary German Guy]], an older mage, used Phoebe as a magical “battery” to power his ritual and close the portal. Her raw magical potential at such a young age was the deciding factor, though the experience left deep, lasting trauma.

- **Post-Event Trauma**: The intense supernatural exposure during the [[California]] events left Phoebe mentally scarred, unable to fully process what happened. This trauma has manifested as a largely catatonic state, punctuated by periods of awareness and occasional supernatural sensitivity.

- **Connection to [[The Promethean]]**: During the Portal Incident, Phoebe formed an unexpected bond with [[The Vampire]]’s Promethean servant. Drawn to her innocence and latent magical potential, the Promethean saw in Phoebe a path toward understanding humanity. This bond may have anchored him to his [[Pilgrimage]], inspiring his eventual turn against the Vampire.

- **Promethean’s Sacrifice**: In a pivotal moment, [[The Promethean]] chose to sacrifice himself to save Phoebe and [[The Monster Squad (group)|the Monster Squad]], allowing himself to be drawn into the portal. This selfless act left a profound impact on Phoebe, who may retain a subconscious memory of his presence.

#### **Current Condition**

- **State of Mind**: Phoebe is mostly catatonic, with her consciousness appearing to withdraw in self-defense. This withdrawal may be psychological, a reaction to trauma, or a result of her early [[Awakening]]. She experiences brief periods of lucidity, though these are rare.

- **Connection to King County’s Supernatural Energy**: It’s unclear if Phoebe’s condition is somehow tied to the supernatural “no-man’s-land” of [[King County, Colorado]]. Her periods of lucidity sometimes correlate with strange occurrences or fluctuations in the local supernatural energy, suggesting she might have a unique sensitivity to the area’s darker secrets.

- **Rudy’s Visits**: [[Rudy Williams]] frequently visits her in the asylum, even though she rarely responds. His dedication seems to provide her with some measure of comfort, as her occasional reactions are most pronounced when he’s nearby.

- **Lingering Psychic Connection**: Given her bond with [[The Promethean]], Phoebe’s catatonic state might be more than trauma—it could be influenced by a subtle psychic or magical link. This connection may be keeping part of her consciousness locked, as though waiting for the Promethean’s return.

- **Residual Effects of Disquiet**: [[The Promethean]]’s [[Disquiet]] may have influenced Phoebe’s perception of the world, amplifying her sensitivity to supernatural energies. This could explain her occasional lucid moments, especially if the environment around her temporarily shifts or aligns with the Promethean’s Wasteland-taint.

#### **Notable Traits / Abilities**

- **Potential for Awakening**: Despite her catatonic state, Phoebe may still possess latent magical potential. Her early signs of [[Awakening]] hint that she could be capable of extraordinary feats if her consciousness were fully accessible.
    
- **Sensitivity to Supernatural Activity**: Phoebe seems to sense changes in [[King County, Colorado]]'s supernatural environment, even if she’s unable to communicate them clearly. This sensitivity could be an asset if tapped into, though her catatonic state makes it difficult to do so.
