She craves “free adventure” as a way to explore the world beyond her lab and her mundane life, but she remains loyal to her employer.
    
- **Supernatural Element**: Amina is a result of an experimental procedure that halted her aging. This could involve either exposure to a supernatural entity or the use of forbidden alchemical practices she studied, which grants her not only extended youth but also unique insights into the hidden and arcane sciences.

- **Relationship with Rudy**: Their history is complex; they may have worked together in the past, but there’s no romantic connection. Instead, they share a mutual respect and a shared experience in the chaos of war, making her presence both familiar and unsettling for Rudy.
