aliases:
  - Mickey
---
**Type**: Vampire (Malkavian Clan)

**Background**: 
- Embraced in the late 1800s by Missy Chamberlain and has lived through multiple identities, accumulating a fractured perception of his past due to his memory lapses.
- Diablerized both Harv and Missy, though he’s forgotten these acts, and now they linger in his mind as spirits with their own autonomy.
- Mickey has a complex and colorful past, with multiple aliases and a recently issued [[Blood Hunt]] against him in [[Castle Dell, Georgia]]. He relocated to [[King County, Colorado|King County]] and currently operates out of [[Stanton City, Colorado|Stanton City]]

**Personality**:

- Exudes charm, but his perception of reality is deeply skewed by his memory issues, which makes him eccentric even by Malkavian standards.
- Convinced of his own mental stability and reliability, he interacts with others confidently, unaware of his many missing memories or the distortions this creates in his understanding.
#### **Derangement: Memory Lapses and “Infallible” Memory**

- **Memory Lapses**: Mickey’s Malkavian derangement causes episodic memory lapses, erasing specific knowledge, skills, or entire spans of history from his mind. These gaps can last decades or longer. Notably:
    - **Era Amnesia**: During the 1960s or 70s, Mickey forgot all prior decades, genuinely believing that history only began then, a belief that continued until the early 2000s. During that period, he adapted to modern settings with ease but had no concept of events, people, or inventions from before the 60s.
    - **Disconnection from Past Identities**: Any skills, professions, or knowledge Mickey once held can disappear without a trace. When these lapses happen, his eidetic memory reorganizes itself to create an internally consistent reality in which those skills or events have simply never existed. For instance, if he forgets he was ever a doctor, the concept of “doctor” becomes entirely foreign to him.
- **“Infallible” Memory Belief**: Mickey is entirely unaware that he has memory issues, believing his memory is flawless due to his eidetic recall. He can’t conceive of himself as someone who forgets, even in the face of contradictory evidence. If someone tries to confront him about a memory gap, he dismisses it with certainty, rationalizing that they must be mistaken or simply lying.
    - This belief results in a deep-seated irony: Mickey remembers everything he’s allowed to remember in painstaking detail, yet he’s unaware of vast swathes of lost information. His confidence in his own memory adds to his eccentricity, as he often dismisses or belittles others for being “less observant” or “more forgetful.”

#### **Relationships with Harv and Missy**

- **Blinded by Memory Gaps**: His inability to recall significant moments with Harv and Missy, such as their diableries, creates an ironic twist. He views them as present, active figures in his life, unaware that they exist as fragments of his past. To Harv and Missy, his inability to remember his violence toward them is darkly amusing, as it means Mickey treats them as family or allies without acknowledging his own betrayal.
    
- **Undisputed Confidence**: Harv and Missy often allow Mickey to maintain his delusions, aware that confronting him about his memory lapses would only frustrate him or lead to dead ends. This shared, unstated agreement keeps the trio functioning, with Mickey unknowingly reliant on his companions for context he’s no longer capable of retaining.

#### **Roleplaying Themes and Dynamics**

- **Anachronism and Confusion**: Mickey’s incomplete memory often makes him anachronistic, with missing knowledge leading to misinterpretations of the modern world. For example, if he forgets an essential skill or cultural concept, he might struggle to navigate situations others find simple.
    
- **Persistent Denial of Forgetfulness**: Mickey’s denial that he could ever forget anything adds a layer of tension and tragic irony to his interactions. This belief makes him unknowingly vulnerable, as his confidence in his memory prevents him from preparing for or acknowledging his own lapses.
    
- **Evolving Relationships with Harv and Missy**: The shifting memories complicate Mickey’s view of his “companions.” Harv and Missy, who remember everything, have developed a wary respect for his distorted worldview, using his amnesia to manipulate him or find humor in his obliviousness.

**Current Activity**: Mickey keeps a low profile but is one of the few vampires active in the area. He may be on the run from hunters or other vampires seeking to fulfill the Blood Hunt order.
