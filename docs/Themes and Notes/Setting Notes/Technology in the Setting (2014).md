_The game setting is notably behind on technological advancements, capturing an “early 2000s” feel rather than true 2014 tech._
#### Internet and Mobile Data
* The internet is about 10 years behind in development, with limited reach and lower speeds. Home connections are primarily dial-up or slow DSL, especially in rural areas like [[King County, Colorado|King County]].
#### Mobile Phones
* **No Smartphones**: Smartphones do not exist in this setting, as the technology has not advanced to that level. 
* Mobile phones are used for basic calls and texts.
* Mobile data, even on newer models, is very limited, with SMS and rudimentary WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) internet being the primary mobile web options.
*  The Motorola Razr V3 is considered cutting-edge, representing the pinnacle of mobile technology for those who can afford it.
	* [[Rudy Williams|Rudy]] uses a Nokia 3310, a durable, reliable model that, though discontinued in 2010, is still widely used by those uninterested in upgrading. 
##### Landlines and Physical Media:
* Landlines are still extremely common and preferred for reliable communication, especially in remote areas where mobile coverage is patchy
* Physical media like VHS, DVDs, and CDs remain in regular use. Streaming do not exist, and most people rely on physical rentals or purchases for entertainment.
