## Notes

The Corrupt Grimoire on page 95 of The Adventure Crafter

LIAR!: This Turning Point involves an active lie. The lie is being committed in this Turning Point. Something someone said or claimed is false. For instance, a vampire lord claims he knows nothing of a magic book, when actually he is seeking it himself. The lie may or may not be detected in this Turning Point.

FAME: Whatever is happening in this Turning Point involves someone famous to some extent. This doesn’t necessarily mean that a famous Character is Invoked, just that the Turning Point has some connection to fame. For instance, if this Turning Point involves learning a secret about another Character, you may learn that they were once a member of a famous superhero group decades ago

EVIDENCE: A Character finds something that helps settle an existing question. For instance, the gun that killed a victim is found stashed under a suspect’s bed.

A NEW ENEMY: This Turning Point presents a new threat to a Character. It is a threat that may or may not be directly related to any Plotlines but must be dealt with all the same. For instance, explorers deep under the earth are moving through an ancient ruin to find their lost comrade when they are beset upon by dinosaurs who nest in the area. This results automatically in a New Character.

Okay, for my first Scene, this is what I have so far.... 

Rudy doesn't have the envelope with the tape, yet. It's just a regular day at Shepherd's Inn, mid afternoon, when someone who looks like a dirty hitch-hiker comes through the door.

This is Bram, who has been hitch-hiking, and is looking for some place he can busk for a meal and maybe a place to sleep. He's pushy -- his role, at least right now, is to be an obstacle to the plotline (which doesn't exist yet, technically) -- and Rudy gets sick of him pretty quickly.

This results in Rudy attempting to bodily throw Bram out of the Inn when something happens to reveal that Bram is not only NOT a dirty hitch-hiking busker but he's someone famous; like a famous musician who puts on a disguise to avoid notice as well as busks to try out new songs. 

For Rudy to know this guy is famous, he would probably have to be some sort of country / western musician. Maybe he's even seen him in concert once or twice. 

That revelation will calm Rudy down a bit and he and Bram start talking -- Rudy's still annoyed, but once Bram's cover is blown (to only Rudy, as the bar is otherwise empty) Bram stops trying to get a gig and will actually pay for some food. 

Then the mail comes. This is where the tape arrives, and Rudy doesn't have any reason to believe it's anything that needs to be secret -- other than the anonymous envelope -- so he pops it in to the Inn's stereo and both he and Bram hear the transcript (above).

Also, while the tape is playing, Dr. Kahn shows up. Rudy is understandably shocked to see her looking as young as when he last saw her. Because of their previous professional relationship, Amina tells Rudy that she's been hired to come find him -- which is weird because she's not some sort of private investigator, but she did know who he was so... -- and she's not sure what her employers want with him, but she'll be telling them later this evening (probably via phone) that she's found him. He'll try to talk her out of it, even going as far as offering money, but she's true to her word.

## Plot Points

|     | Plot Points              | Characters Invoked |
| --- | ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| 1   | Quiet Catastrophe        |                    |
| 2   | A Resource Disappears    |                    |
| 3   | Meta (Character Upgrade) |                    |
| 4   | Something Exotic         |                    |
| 5   | None                     |                    |
## Notes
QUIET CATASTROPHE: Just about the worst thing that can happen does happen. This is similar to the Action Plot Point Catastrophe, except that it is accompanied by less action. For instance, a colonizing spaceship stops midway through a 40 year journey, waking everyone up from their cryo sleep. Or, the investigator discovers the ancient vampire he had destroyed is, somehow, back.

A RESOURCE DISAPPEARS: An important object or resource is stolen by an unknown thief. The resource should be something either useful to a Character, or it should pertain to the Plotline in question.

SOMETHING EXOTIC: Whatever is happening in this Turning Point it involves an unusual or exotic element. For instance, if the Turning Point is about someone being attacked by an assassin, the assassin may have a very unusual identity or mode of attack (maybe he’s disguised as a clown and attacks with exploding balloons, or he is a martial artist with fantastic moves).

Meta: CHARACTER UPGRADE: A Character becomes more important, gaining 2 slots on the Characters List even if it pushes them past 3 slots. When you roll on the Characters List to see who the Character is, treat a result of “New Character” as “Choose The Most Logical Character”. This change can be reflected in the activity in this Turning Point or not.

Rudy saw "[[Clara McKenzie]]" in the back of his truck, which caused him to lose focus on the road, hit a deer, and veer off almost into a nearby ditch.

While he was dealing with the deer, a cop pulled up -- that clearly recognized Rudy -- and may have stolen the cassette.  Or maybe not, but the cassette is gone.
