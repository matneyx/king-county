**Case File:** Clara’s Disappearance (Reopened)  
**Entry:** 1

It’s been a strange day, to put it lightly. Thought I was done with whatever ghosts this county had to offer, but it seems like they’ve come back around.

Started off routine. No sign I was about to be dragged back into this mess. Then this morning, a padded envelope lands on my bar, completely anonymous—no stamp, no return address, nothing. Inside, an old cassette tape. Popped it into the boombox. Should’ve been something simple, a prank or advertisement maybe, but what I heard was [[Clara McKenzie|Clara]]. Her voice, nervous, talking to someone named [[Danny]]. She kept saying she felt unsafe, that she’d seen shadows, heard whispers. I know what paranoia sounds like, but this felt different, darker.

The tape cut out, left me with nothing but questions. First one on my list? Danny. [[Trish]] said he’s out of town now, but pointed me toward [[Mike Hastings]], an old friend of his. Before I could make it to the diner to talk to her, though, I could’ve sworn I saw Clara herself—clear as day—in the bed of my truck. Lost control for a second, hit a deer. By the time I checked, she was gone, and the cassette had disappeared from my truck.

Met up with Trish, who confirmed that Danny’s been hard to reach, drifting around since Clara went missing. She mentioned Mike over at the body shop by the train station might still be in touch with him. Sure enough, Mike had a number for Danny. Didn’t give it up easily, but he’s clearly just as haunted by all this as the rest of us. Warned me not to say his name, said Danny’s not the same as he was.

I don’t know what’s waiting for me at the end of this, but I feel it. [[King County, Colorado|King County]]’s never been an easy place to call home, and days like today make me wonder if it’s worth sticking around. But maybe—just maybe—some closure on Clara’s disappearance will help us all sleep a little better.

**Notes:**

- _Clara_: Last known location unclear. Possible links to local disappearances.
- _Danny_: Known associate, currently out of town. Reaching out tomorrow.
- _Mike Hastings_: Danny’s contact. Cooperative but wary.

**P.S.**

On top of it all, ran into a hitchhiker at the Inn today. Name’s [[Bramble Thorne|Bram]]. Looked like he’d been on the road a while, a real drifter type, but he gave off a weird vibe—said he knew me, even used my name before I told him. Claimed it was just a lucky guess, but something tells me there’s more to him.

And then, like a ghost from my past, Amina showed up. [[Doctor Amina Kahn|Dr. Kahn]], looking exactly like she did back in the Gulf—same face, same voice, like time forgot her. Says she was sent to find me, though she wouldn’t say why or by who. Left me her card, but I’ve got the sinking feeling this isn’t a friendly reunion. Whatever she’s wrapped up in, it’s not a coincidence she’s here. It’s all tied together somehow, but damned if I can see how yet.
