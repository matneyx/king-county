**Audio Transcript Excerpt**: _The tape begins with the sounds of muffled voices in a dimly lit room, punctuated by the faint clinking of glasses._

**Voice 1 (Clara)**: _nervous_ “I just don’t feel safe anymore, Danny. Ever since that night… something isn’t right. I keep seeing shadows, and the way people look at me… it’s like they know something.”

**Voice 2 (Danny)**: _calm but firm_ “You need to let it go, Clara. You’re just imagining things. No one’s out to get you. Just focus on your job. It’ll blow over.”

**Clara**: “But I heard them! I heard the whispers when I was closing up. Something about a sacrifice... a ritual in the woods. I can’t ignore it. I think they’re watching me.”

_The sound of a door creaking open and footsteps echoing._

**Voice 2 (Danny)**: _urgent_ “Listen, if you keep talking like this, you’ll put yourself in danger. Just keep your head down, alright? Promise me you won’t say anything to anyone.”

**Clara**: “I can’t. I have to tell someone! I don’t want to end up like—”

_The tape abruptly cuts off, followed by static before fading to silence._
